# Effects of Satellites on Debris accumulation in Space 
=======================================================

Overview
--------
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jjmasalu/satelliteDataExplorationProject/main?urlpath=lab/tree/Dashboard.ipynb)

This project is designed to explore and visualize the effects of satellites' deployments to the accumulation of debris in space using a combination of Python libraries and tools. The project aims to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring satellite data, with a focus on data visualization and analysis.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.9
* Dash 2.14.2
* Dash Bootstrap Components 1.5.0
* Plotly 5.19.0
* Pandas 2.2.1
* Pyngrok 5.3.0
* Matplotlib
* JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

Installation
------------

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a new Conda environment with the required dependencies.

Running the Project
-------------------

### Option 1: Running locally

To run the project locally, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
This will start the JupyterLab server, and you can access the project by navigating to `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser.

### Option 2: Running on Binder
